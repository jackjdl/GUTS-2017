In one of MIBâ€™s secure prison facilities, aliens have broken out of their cells and started a prison riot.
All the power has been cut off and mayhem has ensued.
Two agents have been called in to clear our the prison of hostiles.

One agent is manning the turret above the prison grounds, however he cannot see the hostiles due to the power outage and the floodlights are off.
The other agent is in the grounds, and notices a flashlight that illuminates a path.

Picking up this flashlight allows him to move to the next area in the prison.
